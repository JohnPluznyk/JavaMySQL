Simple java interface for MySQL

Currently finishing up a final project from my database class.  The project is to create a simple java interface program for MySQL.  So far I have a good part of it done I would say like 75% of the project is complete.  Will be comming
back to this project and tidying it up.  The Trans class was provided to me by my professor which in my opinion needs some editing.  The goal of this project was to make a class called Walkthough.java that the user interacts with in order to
add tables to a database, insert row into a table, and select some records using where and display them.

Will be updating this project in order to make it more useful to the user.
